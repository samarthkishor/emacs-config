#+TITLE: Samarth's Custom Emacs Configuration
#+AUTHOR: Samarth Kishor

* Description

This is my second try at making a custom Emacs configuration. I'm trying to make this a bit less bloated and stick to the bare essentials (without sacrificing nice things I'm used to).

The file =configuration.org= contains most of the settings in a literate format.
